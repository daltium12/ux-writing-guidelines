# Altium Voice and Tone Guidelines

Using a consistent voice and intentional tone builds trust, strengthens brand identity, and helps users feel understood in every interaction with our platform. If you need to write your own UI content, consider using the Voice and Tone guidelines below to help refine your messaging.

---

## Mission

Our mission is the foundation for how we communicate. Voice is shaped by this mission, reflecting our values and personality. Tone builds on that foundation, adapting our voice to different user situations while staying aligned with our greater purpose.

### Altium’s Mission

Our software tools empower and connect PCB designers, part suppliers, and manufacturers to develop and manufacture electronics products faster and more efficiently than ever before. We support this mission through the Altium Platform, which includes the following solutions:

| Solution | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| **Altium Discover** | Equips engineers with a solution-oriented approach for finding, exploring, and selecting solutions that meet specific design requirements. |
| **Altium Develop** | Empowers teams to create as one—across electrical, mechanical, software, and sourcing—with shared data, shared context, and shared purpose. From engineers to managers, Altium Develop brings everyone together to accelerate the delivery of better products to market. |
| **Altium Lifecycle** | Delivers a connected, compliant, and controlled environment, enabling design organizations to manage the complexities of electronics design and processes. |

---

## Voice

Voice is the consistent personality that our brand embodies in its customer-facing interactions. You can think of this as the core writing style that Altium uses in any context.

Altium’s voice is **confident**, **forward-thinking**, and **empowering**. We speak with clarity and purpose to reflect our leadership in the electronics design industry.

### Voice Variables

| Category | Guidance |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Adjectives & Adverbs** | Use adjectives or adverbs to describe the qualities of a product or process (e.g., “Effortlessly collaborate on designs”). |
| **Punctuation** | Use periods for clarity or to provide emphasis. Exclamations are used sparingly and are typically reserved for marketing or onboarding. |
| **Mental Relaxers** | Rarely used. Avoid softeners like “just,” “no worries,” or “simply” and trust the user’s competence. |
| **Metaphors** | Avoid figurative language. Engineers prefer literal, functional language—especially in UI and technical contexts. |
| **Syntax** | Use simple, direct sentence structures. UI content is typically 1–2 sentences. Marketing uses short paragraphs for rhythm and emphasis. |
| **Personalization** | Use second-person (“you”) for clarity when needed, or refer to the user by their first name. |

## Tone

While voice is Altium’s consistent personality, tone determines how we want our customers to feel as they interact with our platform. Tone changes based on context — what a customer is doing and why we’re communicating with them.
