    <title>UX Writing Guidelines - Voice and Tone</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Voice</h1>
    <p>Voice is the consistent personality that our brand embodies in its customer-facing interactions. You can think of this as the core writing style that Altium uses in any context.</p>
    <p>Altium’s voice is <strong>confident</strong>, <strong>forward-thinking</strong>, and <strong>empowering</strong>. We speak with clarity and purpose to reflect our leadership in the electronics design industry.</p>

    <h2>Voice Variables</h2>

        <thead>
            <tr <th>Category</th>

            </tr>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Adjectives &amp; Adverbs</strong></td>
                <td>Use adjectives or adverbs to describe the qualities of a product or process (e.g., “Effortlessly collaborate on designs”).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Punctuation</strong></td>
                <td>Use periods for clarity or to provide emphasis. Exclamations are used sparingly and are typically reserved for marketing or onboarding.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Mental Relaxers</strong></td>
                <td>Rarely used. Avoid softeners like “just,” “no worries,” or “simply” and trust the user’s competence.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Metaphors</strong></td>
                <td>Avoid figurative language. Engineers prefer literal, functional language—especially in UI and technical contexts.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Syntax</strong></td>
                <td>Use simple, direct sentence structures. UI content is typically 1–2 sentences. Marketing uses short paragraphs for rhythm and emphasis.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Personalization</strong></td>
                <td>Use second-person (“you”) for clarity when needed, or refer to the user by their first name.</td>
            </tr>

    <h1>Tone</h1>
    <p>While voice is Altium’s consistent personality, tone determines how we want our customers to feel as they interact with our platform. Tone changes based on context — what a customer is doing and why we’re communicating with them.</p>
